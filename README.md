# Web app testing
In this repository I illustrate the entire testing process of an e-commerce website. I'll create a mind-map of the whole process, provide a few sample Use Case Scenarios, design Test Cases in Testlink, execute them, create Bug Reports and finish things with a nice Test Report.

**This is a work in progress and will take some time, but thanks to the nature of Github I'll be able to make frequent updates.**

## Here's the website:

## And here's the mind map (click for an up to date version):

## Testing metodology
All tests are performed on following browsers: Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave.

All browsers are up-to-date and have no extra plugins installed.

Mobile version of website is tested on one available physical device (ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2) and on popular devices simulated by browser's developer tools.

## [HERE](https://github.com/lech-dabrowski/Portfolio-Web-application/blob/main/Test%20Cases.md) is a hub for all test cases grouped by category.

## Finally all the bugs I've found are reported [HERE](https://github.com/lech-dabrowski/Portfolio-Web-application/blob/main/Bug%20Reports.md)

## Test Report will probably take form of a PDF document, so I'm leaving this line here as a placeholder for a download link.
