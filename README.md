# Web app testing
In this repository I illustrate the entire testing process of an e-commerce website. I'll create a mind-map of the whole process, provide a few sample Use Case Scenarios, design Test Cases in Testlink, execute them, create Bug Reports and finish things with a nice Test Report.

**This is a work in progress and will take some time, but thanks to the nature of Github I'll be able to make frequent updates.**

## Here's the website:

## And here's the mind map (click for an up to date version):

## [HERE](https://github.com/lech-dabrowski/Portfolio-Web-application/blob/main/Test%20Cases.md) is a hub for all test cases grouped by category.

## Finally all the bugs I've found are reported [HERE](https://github.com/lech-dabrowski/Portfolio-Web-application/blob/main/Bug%20Reports.md)

## Test Report will probably take form of a PDF document, so I'm leaving this line here as a placeholder for a download link.
