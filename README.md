# Web app testing
In this repository I illustrate the entire testing process of an e-commerce website. I'll create a mind-map of the whole process, provide a few sample Use Case Scenarios, design Test Cases in Testlink, execute them, create Bug Reports and finish things with a nice Test Report.
**This is a work in progress and will take some time, but thanks to the nature of Github I'll be able to make frequent updates.**
